You pause at the intersection, the corridor stretching cleanly ahead toward the north. Sleek metallic walls reflect a cool, bluish glow from long LED strips recessed along the ceiling. To your left, another passage leads west, dimly inviting exploration. To your right, the corridor ends abruptly, sealed by a smooth wall dotted with softly glowing screens.

Curious, you step closer, studying the screens embedded in the eastern wall. They gently pulse, cycling through calm streams of information: oxygen levels stable, energy consumption normal, and a small scrolling list of recent crew activities. One entry flashes briefly, catching your attention: "Sensor anomaly in Sector 12-C—investigation pending." Another display shows the vessel's current position, stationary in an unknown star system, distant planets glowing softly on the map.

At your feet sits an unexpected sign of life—a small green plant, its leaves stirring slightly in the gentle flow of recycled air. You wonder who placed it there and why, amid the sterile metallic surroundings. Looking up again, you now face a decision: continue straight ahead, explore the shadowed passage to the west, or linger a bit longer, examining the intriguing information before you.
